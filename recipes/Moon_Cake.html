            <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>To make salted duck eggs from scratch, wash the outside of the eggs before arranging them in the brining vessel. Cover them completely in water before pouring this water out into a pot. Set the eggs outside in the sun (during the early morning, not the late morning or afternoon) and let them sunbathe for 2-4 hours</li>
                <li>Using the ratio of â…“ cup salt to every 1 kg of water, add salt to the water previously set aside and boil it. Once boiled, let it cool to room temperature. Let the brining vessel dry out completely.</li>
                <li>Add the liquor to a bowl and submerge the eggs for 1 hour. Then add the eggs to the dry brining vessel along with the liquor and the cooled salt water. Seal the vessel and let it rest for 30 days or more.</li>
                <li>After they have brined for a month, boil one egg in salt water. Cut them in half to check the yolk. If it is cured and hard, boil 3 other eggs and remove their yolks.</li>
                <li>Once cooked, they are now ready to be used to make Cantonese mooncake.</li>
